# Yarra River Water Quality Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing the water quality data of the Yarra River. It includes a Jupyter Notebook for data analysis and an Excel file containing the water quality dataset.

## File Descriptions

1. **`LMP_YarraRiver_WQ.ipynb`**
   - **Description**:  
     This Jupyter Notebook performs data loading, cleaning, visualization, and basic statistical analysis of Yarra River water quality data.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Data preprocessing
     - Visualization of water quality trends
     - Summary and conclusions from the data
   - **Requirements**:
     The following Python libraries are required to run the notebook:
     - `pandas`
     - `matplotlib`
     - `numpy`
     - `seaborn`

2. **`LMP_YarraRiver_WQ.xlsx`**
   - **Description**:  
     This Excel file contains the raw or cleaned water quality data for the Yarra River.
   - **Contents**:
     - Each column represents a different water quality parameter (e.g., pH, dissolved oxygen, temperature, etc.).
     - Each row corresponds to a specific sampling time or location.
   - **Purpose**:  
     This file serves as the primary data source for the analysis in the Jupyter Notebook.

## How to Use

1. **Set up the Environment**:
   - Ensure Python and Jupyter Notebook are installed.
   - Install the required libraries:
     ```bash
     pip install pandas matplotlib numpy seaborn
     ```

2. **Run the Notebook**:
   - Place `LMP_YarraRiver_WQ.ipynb` and `LMP_YarraRiver_WQ.xlsx` in the same directory.
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook, load `LMP_YarraRiver_WQ.ipynb`, and run each code cell sequentially.
